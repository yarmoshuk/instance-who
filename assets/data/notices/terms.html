</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1476">
This document describes the Terms and Conditions of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regarding the external use of public health and HIV data in Twine.
</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1473">
UNHCR recognises the importance of contributing to the growing international efforts in data sharing and is committed to obtaining the best quality and value out of funds invested in public health and HIV programmes. UNHCR believes that helping to make operational data more readily available will reinforce open scientific enquiry and stimulate new investigations and analyses in international public health. Conscious of privacy concerns, UNHCR only considers aggregated, non-identifiable data, as suitable for sharing.
</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1474">
UNHCR supports the view that data sharing should be led by the international public health community and be driven by the need to improve the quality of health services offered to populations of concern. It should also be cost effective and the data shared should be of the highest quality. Members of the international public health community are expected and encouraged to practice and promote data sharing, determine standards and best practice, and create a culture in which data sharing is commonplace. UNHCR will advocate for support and funding to facilitate this.

<a name="B_Background" id="B_Background"><strong>B. Background</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1478">
UNHCR leads a Health Information System (HIS) project that generates large volumes of public health data from camp-based refugee operations around the world. This includes information on a range of primary health care services; including mortality, morbidity, immunization, nutrition, reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.
</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1483">
With the support of Information Management &amp; Mine Action Programs (iMMAP), UNHCR has developed software capable of storing and managing this data in a single database. Such data are important not only for the partner organisations originating the data and overseeing public health programmes in the field, but also to the wider public health community which may wish to examine and use these datasets to support other investigations that lead to new public health understanding and lines of enquiry.
</p>
<p class="abouttitle">
<a name="C_Goals" id="C_Goals"><strong>C. Goals of data sharing</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
<strong>Why share data?</strong><br>
UNHCR supports the view that public health data are a public good produced in the public interest and should be openly available to the maximum extent possible. UNHCR believes that helping to make HIS data more readily available will reinforce open scientific enquiry, promote data quality, encourage diversity of analysis and opinion, and stimulate new investigations and analyses.
</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1482">
<strong>Who benefits from data sharing?</strong><br>
Operational data are important not only for the partner organisations originating the data but also to the wider public health community, which may wish to examine and use these datasets to support other investigations. The ultimate aim is to remain accountable to beneficiaries by delivering quality public health programmes whilst also demonstrating value for money to donors. In this way refugees, UNHCR and its implementing partners, donors and the wider public health community can all benefit from data sharing.

<a name="D_Considerations" id="D_Considerations"><strong>D. General considerations</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext" id="ext-gen1480">
<strong>Scope</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. These terms and conditions apply to aggregated data generated by the HIS. They do not cover individual case-based data, or data collected from other methodologies (e.g. surveys, sentinel surveillance, assessments).<br>
<br>
<strong>Consent</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. UNHCR will only share HIS data with the prior consent of partner organisation(s) responsible for primary data collection in the field.<br>
<br>
<strong>Data ownership</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Ownership of the data generated from the HIS resides with UNHCR. However, due recognition will be given at all times to partners responsible for data collection and reporting in the field (see F.iii).<br>
<br>
<strong>Data context</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. UNHCR recognises the importance of data quality and provenance. HIS data are entirely quantitative and UNHCR cannot always guarantee it will be accompanied by contextual information or documentation to provide a secondary user with details on the origin or manipulation of the data, in order to prevent any misuse, misinterpretation or confusion. External agencies should contact UNHCR for further clarification as required on the provenance and reliability of the data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Data quality</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. UNHCR takes all reasonable steps to ensure that HIS data are accurate, complete, and current, subject to regular updates and corrections by field teams whenever necessary.<br>
<br>
<strong>Timeliness</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. UNHCR will attempt to release and share the routine HIS data in a timely fashion each month, subject to unavoidable operational constraints and challenges in the field.<br>
<br>
<strong>Database copyright</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vii. The structure and the data sheets within the HIS database reflect sufficient creativity for copyright to apply to UNHCR. In accordance with UNHCR's internal regulations, and with this document, UNHCR may grant copyright permission.<br>
<br>
viii. Some software contained in the HIS database is protected by copyright which is owned and controlled by the third party software provider who creates that software and licenses it to iMMAP.<br>
</p>
<p class="abouttitle">
<a name="E_ReqProcedure" id="E_ReqProcedure"><strong>E. Request procedure</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
A brief proposal must be submitted prior to granting access to the HIS data.&nbsp; The proposal must indicate the objectives of the project and briefly describe how the HIS data will be used and the potential benefits to UNHCR's populations of concern.&nbsp; The proposal must state which caseloads are to be included in the data set (i.e. list the specific camps from which data are required), describe any exclusion restrictions, and state what data items are required.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
UNHCR will review the merit and feasibility of each proposal, including whether there is sufficient data to provide adequate information for analysis and the availability of the required data.&nbsp; Final release of the data is subject to the conditions stated below.
</p>
<p class="abouttitle">
<a name="F_RelConditions" id="F_RelConditions"><strong>F. Release conditions</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
Release of data for operational research purposes is subject to the following conditions:<br>
<br>
<strong>Ethical considerations</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. UNHCR expects that external agencies accessing HIS data must observe ethical and legal obligations pertaining to the data. All operational research using HIS data is subject to UNHCR's&nbsp;<em>Code of Conduct</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Policy on Ethical Use of Data</em>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Probity</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. External agencies must agree to use the data only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with terms defined in the original proposal. If the agency later wishes to use the data in a new project, a new proposal must be submitted.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recognition</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. UNHCR requires that those enabling sharing are to receive full and appropriate recognition. Therefore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If the data becomes part of any manuscript that is prepared for a publication, the agency shall consult the UNHCR concerning the possibility of a potential co-authorship;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If the data are used in a publication, the partner organisation(s) involved in primary data collection should be mentioned in the acknowledgements or be cited in the reference list of the publication;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The following format should be used to cite data retrieved from Twine: &nbsp;<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Public Health and HIV data are provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) (accessed through Twine, http://twine.unhcr.org, on dd-mm-yyyy)"</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. UNHCR and the partner organisation(s) involved in primary data collection are to receive copies of any resulting publications.<br>
<br>
<strong>Actionable</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Partner organisation(s) and staff who collected the data have an interest in benefiting from any conclusions and findings in the secondary analysis. Therefore UNHCR expects conclusions generated from HIS data to be made available in a timely and responsible manner for subsequent action in the field.<br>
<br>
<strong>Non-derivative</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. External partners are only permitted to present and publish&nbsp;<em>original</em>&nbsp;copies of the HIS dataset. Derivative copies of the dataset are not permitted to be shared without prior permission. Requests from third parties for access to the data which was previously made available to the external partner shall be referred to HQHIS@unhcr.org.<br>
<br>
<strong>Non-commercial</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi. HIS data are free of charge. External agencies are permitted to present and publish&nbsp;<em>original&nbsp;</em>data, but for non-commercial purposes only.<br>
<br>
<strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vii. UNHCR does not guarantee in any way the accuracy of the figures of the HIS data and by consequence UNHCR shall not be held liable for any losses caused by reliance on its correctness, accuracy or reliability.&nbsp;All reasonable steps will be taken to uphold the quality and completeness of data, but this cannot be guaranteed and external agencies use these data at their own risk.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;viii. The boundaries and names shown and the designations used in the maps in Twine do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the UNHCR concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.<br>
<br>
<strong>Other considerations</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ix. The general considerations discussed in Part D and methods of data sharing in Part G must be agreed to in writing prior to any release of the HIS data.<br>
</p>
<p class="abouttitle">
<a name="G_Method" id="G_Method"><strong>G. Method of data sharing</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
External agencies must respect the reporting cycle which has been established for the HIS and will receive all datasets from UNHCR Headquarters in Geneva. Direct requests for datasets to other UNHCR offices or partner organisations will not be entertained.
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
Timescales for data sharing, operational review and release of main findings will need to be determined in discuss with each requesting agency. Mechanisms for informing best practice in the field will also need to be established.<br>
</p>
<p class="abouttitle">
<a name="H_Monitoring" id="H_Monitoring"><strong>H. Monitoring of data sharing</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
Adherence to the proposed data management and sharing strategy will be monitored through regular inter-agency reviews.<br>
</p>
<p class="abouttitle">
<a name="I_Funding" id="I_Funding"><strong>I. Funding of data sharing</strong></a><br>
</p>
<p class="abouttext">
UNHCR recognises that data sharing has time and cost implications. Funding to support the management and sharing of operational data (for example staffing, physical resources such as storage and networking capability) may need to be incorporated into the overall running costs of the HIS project.<br>
